### Description
This use case will focus on the use of HoloLens for helping to teach job skills to people with autism, particularly those aging out of
the supports provided in the school environment. Unemployment for those with autism is significant and the supports in the work
environment are limited. The use case will use HoloLens augmented reality to help with basic job skills by presenting a visual cues
on how to complete task such as stocking shelves or preparing food. This scenario should also address the issue of moving away
from 1:1 support to a 1:n as an a student becomes an adult.

Hackathon Objective Create a HoloLens demo based on a common work scenario demonstrating the visual “activity schedule” which the subject can see
while working.

Open Source Objective Build a baseline of code demonstrating the scenario so others can extend it by adding new scenarios and potentially use the code
for a commercial solution in the space
